                    <p>In the corporate world, we&rsquo;re talking more than ever about the link between well-being and productivity &ndash; while still grappling with the impact of stress and burnout. Well-being programs that kick-in at crisis points are simply ineffective. And around the world, millions of employees are struggling, forcing organizations to cope with the fallout of absences and low productivity.</p>
